Benjy! Ah, itâ€™s been a ride. Iâ€™m so glad our paths crossed here at MT and at the Met Office. Iâ€™ve learned so much working with you and also genuinely enjoyed our collaboration (which is the kind of vibe that doesnâ€™t come round every day). Thanks for all the different chats, about research, design, and far beyond. Iâ€™m also inspired by your commitment to inclusive design. Wishing you all the very best with your contracting journey; no doubt youâ€™re going to smash it. Thanks for everything and keep in touch! Big hugs :green_heart:
